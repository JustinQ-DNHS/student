## Review of Week 5
 
### Tuesday
Added Xaviers ediited calculator format to my website, I then proceeded to talk with Daniel and Xavier about how to fix errors / bugs with the calculator. After Daniel figured out why decimals weren't working we proceeded to explain what we understood about arrays and variables in general, and Xavier shared his knowledge on functions.

### Wednesday
The Live Review of the calculator was  today and apparently the GPA calculator was necessary, as we were not aware of this we did not work on it at all. However our normal calculator was very good and successful. We went first. We also went through animating with a sprite sheet and are now trying to figure out how to use sprite sheets.
