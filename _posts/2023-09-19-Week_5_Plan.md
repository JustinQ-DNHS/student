## Review of Week 5
 
### Tuesday
Added Xaviers ediited calculator format to my website, I then proceeded to talk with Daniel and Xavier about how to fix errors / bugs with the calculator. After Daniel figured out why decimals weren't working we proceeded to explain what we understood about arrays and variables in general, and Xavier shared his knowledge on functions.
