## Review of Week 4

### Monday
First Mr. Mortensen showed an example of a JavaScript input and output device in the form of an average calculator, he then showed a regular calculator to explain JavaScript. Afterwards I decided to finally change my theme since I did not know how to change the color of the buttons at the top and didn't like the format. I switched to Cayman but didn't like the color and spent a majoryity of class trying to figure out how to switch the color, deciding to use the simple route of adding a "< style >" tag into the default.html file.

### Tuesday
We go into class and I decide to work on blogging how I created some of my "hacks". So I create the "Creation of Snake" page and begin explaining how I created the Snake program. However, I wanted to create collapsable parts and proceed to spend the entirety of class trying to get it to work, eventually I decide to copy and paste and fine tune it to work for my website. It everntually works, although I will work to figure out how it all works soon.

### Wednesday
Both Computer Science classes met in Mr. Mortensen's larger room where Mr. Mortensen began to explain something new to us. He proceeds to explain "Agile Methodology". | If there is a system for working it makes a lot more effective, without those it's just chaos. "AM" basically is a big meeting every (x) weeks and start planning off the project planners. Break down piece of objective into things to work on, figure out what dependancies are needed. Schedule out plans for up 12 weeks at a time. At the end of the milestone do the meeting again. "AM" is a big deal within the programming community. Customize "AM" "SAFE" to work for your group. Exploration is important incase sometimes code doesn't work, this is not something you can just procrastinate as things can go wrong. | Don't commit everything the night before a live review, do not commit a lot at once, instead commit in increments | Working software is primary source of progress | Scrum master: facilitator, decides decisions between two groups and scrum master must make the choice. | Scurm board: may issign an issue to a person for them to fix. There are 5 different states for each project/issue | Wants us to build Agile manifesto, build agile methodology diagram, add team member roles, create issues and scrum board, build individual issues,
