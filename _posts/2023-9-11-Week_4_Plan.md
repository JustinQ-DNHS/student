## Review of Week 4

### Monday
First Mr. Mortensen showed an example of a JavaScript input and output device in the form of an average calculator, he then showed a regular calculator to explain JavaScript. Afterwards I decided to finally change my theme since I did not know how to change the color of the buttons at the top and didn't like the format. I switched to Cayman but didn't like the color and spent a majoryity of class trying to figure out how to switch the color, deciding to use the simple route of adding a "< style >" tag into the default.html file.
